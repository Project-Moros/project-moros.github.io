				<h2>[BLOG UPDATE] 2 Months No Updates</h2>
				<p>Well, I was sorta gone for 2 months and no development was done after version 0.1.6 which was an oopsie. There is no active developers on our team so it's basically on me for the lack of development. I plan on updating you guys more on this blog.</p>
				<br />
				<p>However, on another note. There is an open beta site for those who want to be testers! You can apply <a href="#">here</a> (BETA is full so there is no link to google form). There is 20 slots for people but if a lot of people want beta access the amount can change.</p>

				<h2>[BLOG UPDATE] Game's and Game Count</h2>
				<p>First official update that gives something in writing for people to read! This is comming from the head developer and I have to say I'm quite excited to see where the development leads. None the less, you came here to hear about games. As for how many games will be on the site is undetermined but it should be upwards of 75. The games will include around about 30 HTML based games, 20 Adobe Flash games, and a handful of ROMs (unsure how many yet).</p>
				<br />
				<p>The majority of the ROMs are emulated using <a href="https://github.com/ethanaobrien/emulatorjs" target="_blank">EmulatorJS</a>, MSDOS programs are emulated using <a href="https://js-dos.com/" target="_blank">JSDOS</a>, and the Adobe Flash games will be emulated using <a href="https://ruffle.rs/" target="_blank">Ruffle</a>. I think that's all from me so see you in the next update. (^_^ )</p>
